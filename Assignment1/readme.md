How to run the program

- Open Assignment1.sln using Visual Studio
- In the Solution Explorer window on the right side, you can see all the python files
- To run a file, double click it to open the code, then right click anywhere on the code and click "Start without Debugging"
- The csv files will be generated in the same directory as the python files

NOTE: If the csv files already exist, they will be overwritten with each execution of the code. If they do not exist, they will be created automatically.
